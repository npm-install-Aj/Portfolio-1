AJ's Interaction Design Portfolio

This repository has been created to support my submission towards the final assignment of creating a portfolio website, for SEM 1,CS6041 - INTERACTIVE MEDIA PROJECT/WORKSHOP 1, In Masters in Interaction and Experience Design, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland. 

Technologies used to create this web portfolio :

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Bootstrap - only css (not the JS)
Jquery - only referenced as a dependency for Glightbox
FontAwesome - Icon library
Glightbox.min.js - Library used for Image Gallery
Typed.js - For styling on the landing page.
Bootstrap - only Ulitity classes are used from bootstrap 

**HTML**
 - Tested for Tabindex 
 - Updated the title for every page in the website 
 - Responsive web development has been exercised. 
 
**CSS** 
 - Flex based styling has been exercised wherever possible
 - CSS Specificity has been leveraged
 - usage of pseudoelements such as :before and :after
 - usage of pseudoclasses such as :focus, :active and :hover
 
**External Source Code**
- A blend of styling was sought mainly from bootsnipp.com and only for the footer component

**Iframes from YouTube and Figma** have a sizing issue, however I have tried my best to stick to the responsiveness.

**All the libraries used are CDNs (for a faster fetch time from server**

The future roadmap of this portfolio is to, refine it and have it migrated to a Modern Web Technology Single Page Application (SPA) framework such as Angular/React utilizing SASS/SCSS with a backend of Node/Express/ NoSQL DB such as MongoDb or Casadra etc, following the best web practices and technology.
