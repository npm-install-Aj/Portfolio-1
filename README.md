AJ's Interaction Design Portfolio

This repository has been created to support my submission towards the final assignment of creating a portfolio website, for SEM 1, Masters in Interaction and Experience Design, University of Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.

Some of the work described in the portfolio currently belongs to the organisations that I had worked for at that particular timeline and I do not own any part of the work however I had been fortunate to have contributed to the same towards its fruition.

Technologies used to create this web portfolio :

HTML
JavaScript
CSS
Bootstrap
Jquery
The future roadmap of this portfolio is to have it migrated to a Modern Web Technology Single Page Application (SPA) framework such as Angular/React utilizing SASS/SCSS with a backend of Node/Express/ NoSQL DB such as MongoDb or Casadra etc, following the best web practices and technology.
