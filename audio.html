                    It is a pleasant morning and the birds are doing their usual routine, chirping by my window. My eyes open, but the motivation is not strong enough to wake up, waiting up for the alarm to ring, so that I can snooze it to have more sleep. I do snooze it and wake up at its second ring. I had just realised that I am going to be late for the class, I wake up and rush to the bathroom, to get ready. I leave the room, get out of the house after getting downstairs. I lock the door and start heading towards the bus stop. It is now, I realise that I am extremely late, I run towards the bus stop. just in time for the bus, A bus stops right when I get there, I board it with a sigh of relief. However, I still hope that I would somehow make it to the class on time. I get off the bus and dash towards the class, as I do, I hear the bell go, people come out of their lecture halls onto the corridor. I enter the designated lecture hall and notice that the class had just started, I listen to the lecturer and start taking notes, when the class gets over, The bell goes again, marking the end of the class.
